I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of employee data, delving into crucial aspects such as age distribution and workplace distribution. Leveraging SQL, I meticulously imported and organized the dataset, ensuring seamless accessibility for analysis. With a keen eye for detail, I formulated pertinent queries to extract insights, addressing pivotal questions such as the predominant work locations and the distribution of employee ages across the organization. The culmination of this analytical journey manifested in a dynamic and visually compelling report crafted using Power BI. This report not only synthesized the findings but also provided actionable recommendations, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making and optimize organizational efficiency. Through this project, I demonstrated not only proficiency in data handling and analysis but also a commitment to driving data-driven solutions for organizational growth and success.
